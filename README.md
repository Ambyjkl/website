# Loo SE 2021

### Developer Setup

* Make sure you have nodejs, npm and git installed (if not, [rtfm](https://google.com))
* On your command line

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/UWaterlooSE2021/sexxi.xyz/
$ cd sexxi.xyz
$ npm install # Install all of the dependencies
$ npm start # Start development servers

# Now you can visit the site on localhost:3000
```

**Note**
We actually have two dev servers running here. One listens to port 3000 and the other listens to port 4200.
But you only need the one that listens to 3000.
